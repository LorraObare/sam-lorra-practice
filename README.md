React + Laravel Login System

📋 Project Overview

This project is a collaborative effort aimed at designing and implementing a functional and secure login system using React for the frontend and Laravel(PHP) with MySQL for the backend.

The goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of full-stack development and ensure that we can successfully build and integrate a login system that securely authenticates users through an API-driven architecture.

👥 Collaboration Objective

As part of this project, both contributors have taken on roles that focus on frontend and backend development respectively. The collaboration emphasizes shared learning, skill development, and implementation of best practices in secure authentication.

🛠️ Technologies Used

✅ Frontend – React.js

- Why React?
  - React is a modern, component-based JavaScript library.
  - It provides efficient rendering and excellent support for building interactive UIs.
  - Its unidirectional data flow and hooks system make managing state in forms like login easy and maintainable.

✅ Backend – Laravel (PHP)

- Why Laravel?
  - Laravel is a robust PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly features.
  - It offers built-in authentication support, API handling, middleware for security, and integration with MySQL.
  - It uses **Laravel Sanctum** for token-based API authentication, which is ideal for React-based frontends.

✅ Database – MySQL
  -Why MySQL?
  - MySQL is a reliable and widely used relational database system.
  - It integrates seamlessly with Laravel's Eloquent ORM for handling data and migrations.

🌐 Key Features

- User registration and login
- Token-based API authentication (Laravel Sanctum)
- Secure password hashing and CSRF protection
- Seamless communication between React frontend and Laravel backend
- CORS support for cross-origin API requests

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repositories (frontend and backend separately).
2. Set up the backend:**
   - Install dependencies via Composer.
   - Configure `.env` for database access.
   - Run `php artisan migrate`.
3. Run the frontend:
   - Use `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
   - Ensure proper API integration with backend endpoints.
4. Test authentication flow (register, login, protected routes).

📌 Note

This project is a learning initiative and a demonstration of how full-stack applications can be securely developed using modern frameworks. Feedback and improvements are always welcome.
